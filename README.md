# Health-Centric Food Safety Evaluation

## Problem Statement

Develop a health-centric machine learning solution that evaluates the safety of food consumption based on user-specified nutritional constraints. Users will interact with a user interface to input constraints on calories, fats, saturated fats, cholesterol, and trans fats. The machine learning model will process this information and deliver a simple binary output, indicating whether the selected food item is deemed "safe" or "not safe" for consumption. The objective is to provide users with quick and clear insights, enabling them to make healthier dietary choices effortlessly.
